#CoFindMe

I am currently looking for someone to start a company with. I am however picky on when it comes to picking the right cofounder because I want him to be technical and willing to join a startup. Presently, there are no platforms that connect technical cofounders. They say finding a proper founder is a very hard thing to do. CoFindme facilitates this process.

CoFindme specializes in the connection of technical cofounders. When interested in someone, you proceed by clicking the message button and this my friend, might be the start of a new life.
